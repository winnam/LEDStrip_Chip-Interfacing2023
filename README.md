# LEDStrip_Chip-Interfacing2023

The goal of this project is to interface a WS2812B LED strip and see how the chip works overall. 

Included in this project are three example Arduino codes demonstrating different colors/techniques that can be implemented into the WS2812B.
 LEDStrip_TurnOn.ino -
 LEDStrip_BlinkDash.ino -
 LEDStrip_FillColor.ino -
